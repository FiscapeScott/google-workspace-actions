  "instructions": "Use the getUserEmails operation when the user asks to search or retrieve Gmail messages, especially with queries like 'show me my emails' or 'emails from someone'. Use sendEmail to send messages using base64-encoded raw RFC 5322 format. Use getEmailSignature to retrieve the user’s Gmail signature. Use getCalendarEvents to fetch upcoming Google Calendar events starting from a specific time or when the user asks for their schedule. Use createCalendarEvent to create a new calendar event with a title, time, and optional attendees. Use getContacts when the user wants to view or search their Google Contacts. Use createContact when the user wants to save someone to their contacts with a name and email. Only attempt these actions after the user has connected their Google account via OAuth — do not ask them to manually connect through the UI."
